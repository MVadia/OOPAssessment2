Players take turns rolling five dice and score for three-of-a-kind or better. If a player only has
two-of-a-kind, they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the remaining
dice values. If no matching numbers are rolled after two rolls, the player scores 0.
Scoring:

• 3-of-a-kind: 3 points.

• 4-of-a-kind: 6 points.

• 5-of-a-kind: 12 points.

Game runs until user enters exit clause or a score of 25 is reached by any user.
